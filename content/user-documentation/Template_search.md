### What is a Template Search ?

------

A template search is a pre-defined query that has been have created for you. A template search allows you to search the database without having to construct your own query or understand the underlying data structure. A library of template searches covering the full range of data is available.

A template search consists of a simple form with one or more options for you to enter or select. Default values are always provided so you can immediately run them and see if they return the data you are after.

Each template has a short name and a longer description. We provide a short name so you can quickly scan the available searches and find the one that you need. The longer description will provide you with more details and any limitations to the values you can enter.

To access the template library click on the templates tab in the main menu bar.

### Running a Template Search

---

A template search provides you with a form, with one or more variables to set. Some will require you to enter a value, while others will provide drop-down lists for you to select from. Once you are satisfied with your options, simply click *View rows* to run the search taking you to the report page.

### Running a Template with a list of genes

Using a public list of genes or your own list (remember to log in first to enable access to personal lists ), you can run a template search.
To search a list,click on the *In List* option, then in the next drop-down you can choose either recently created list(personal) or publicly available list.

### Understanding your results

---

The template search returns results in  tabular format with a range of options. As well as displaying your results, the results tables are a powerful analysis tool as well. See the [Results Tables](https://flymine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/results-tables/Documentationresultstables.html#resultstables) for more details and for information on how to save or download your results.

### Trouble Shooting

---

My template returns no results - why?

All templates should return results with the default values provided (please [Contact Us](info@intermine.org) if you find one that doesn’t). If you have provided your own values, in most cases it will mean we don’t have the data you are looking for. In some cases, however, particularly for more complicated searches with optional constraints, it may be because of the way the search is constructed - some of the required data may be there but not all of it, resulting in no results. Please [Contact Us](info@intermine.org) if you require further assistance.
