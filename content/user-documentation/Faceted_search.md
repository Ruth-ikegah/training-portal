This is a sample tutorial for using a search on HumanMine.

HumanMine is an integrated database of *Homo Sapiens* genomic data.

**Aim:** Search for TNF in the HumanMine and create a list of publications.

### Steps

1. Search for Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) using the "search any term"

Human Necrosis Factor is the first gene result in the list that shows when HumanMine is clicked.
